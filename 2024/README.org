* Advent of Code 2024
To be quirky I decided to scramble through a bunch of random programming languages that I want to learn/master and use a different one every day of advent of code.

The ones ive used
** Day 1 - C
Its something I've used before
** Day 2 - Go
I've also used go before so nothing new
** Day 3 - C#
*** Installation Process
Running C# code seems to require installing the dotnet sdk which i install very chaddly with nixos and write my first hello world code
*** General thoughts
You use the dotnet binary
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/top-level-templates
- apparently a new change just appeared in C# when it went to .NET 6 removing the main method from the default template, kinda weird and it seems recent so im gonna use the old template for now
- setting up the lsp was kinda easy
